# aboutmepdx

This is a demo 'about me' page for Code Fellows PDX's 201 level web development course. It uses prompts and alerts to demonstrate entry-level JS knowledge in the form of a goofy quiz that I had fun writing, and displays extremely rudimentary HTML and CSS. I used Skeleton (getskeleton.com) to get everything polished a bit and messed around with fonts. In my files you can see the beginnings of a separate HTML page, which I had planned to move the quiz over to. I may update soon, but that depends on the rest of the course workload and direction.
