        <p>I was born at the age of 6 in the Midwestern rain. I have clawed my way to the top by being ruthless and rude,<br/> and here I am making a dang old website. This is a concept art piece, a self-portrait.<br/> I have studied all the CSS stylesheets in the world and found the best color schemes.<br/>Enjoy my quiz, which is the pride and joy of this immaculate website domain.</p>
